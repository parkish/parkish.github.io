        One thing that I particularly like about Sudoku is that you can solve a puzzle purely through deduction. I got a big calendar
        of Sudoku puzzles at one point and as I was going through them I started finding puzzles that seemed to not work
        that way - it appeared that the only way to solve them was to guess a value and then walk those guesses throughout
        the remaining squares. Which seemed really lame to me.
    </p>

    <p>
        So to try to prove to myself that I wasn't crazy and that it was the grid's fault, NOT MINE (sorry), I wrote this little
        solver that runs through the techniques I use to solve Sudoku grids.
    </p>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Grey squares mean the solver was able to deduce a value for it.</li>
            <li>Squares that are unsolved/ambiguous show the remaining possibilities in red</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="grid">
    </div>
    <div>
        <div>Possible values:<span id="possibles"></span></div>
        <div><select id="predefinedGrids" onchange="onChangeSelect(this)"></select></div>
        <div>
            <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="sudoku.js"></script>
            <script src="gamedata.js"></script>
            <script>loadGrid();</script>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
